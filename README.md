## Star Gazing 

This application was created by Breelyn Betts using different endpoints of the Nasa API and the Google Maps Api.

### Get Started: 

```
1. git clone 
2. cd react/
3. npm install
4. npm start 
// One of the endpoints does not work unless a Node Relay is also run, in order to do so run the command in a separate terminal window: 
5. node node-http-relay.js
6. navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the project! 
```
