# Star Gazing

This application was created by Breelyn Betts using different endpoints of the Nasa API and the Google Maps Api.

## Get Started:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/breelynbetts/star-gazing.git
2. cd star-gazing/
3. npm install
4. npm start
// Because of CORS, a Node Relay is required for the app to function properly
// In a separate terminal window run the command:
5. node node-http-relay.js
6. navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the project!
```

To see testing :

```
1. npm test
```

This project was built in [CMSI 370 - Interaction Design](https://bulletin.lmu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=2&coid=4753).
