| **Test Suite** | 24 successes out of 26 total<br><br>**Statements** 119/146 (81.51%)<br>**Branches** 15/24 (62.50%)<br>**Functions** 44/61 (72.13%)<br>**Lines** 108/130 (83.08%)<br><br>High coverage is maintained, but `searchEvents` was not consistently stubbed (e.g., `Events` test) so the test code inadvertently made real API requests a few times—it was luck (bad?) that your API happened to be OK with open requests (–2) | 18/20 |
| **Linting** | No real-API-specific linting issues seen |  |
| **Version Control** | Good commit frequency and granularity; descriptive messages |  |
